<br>6566<br>
<br>One morning, with the help of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Fallay Venphira (x) - cousin" data-href="#Fallay Venphira (x) - cousin" href="about:blank#Fallay_Venphira_(x)_-_cousin" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">his cousin</a>, he snuck out of his quarters and explored beyond <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="The Venphira Family Estate" data-href="#The Venphira Family Estate" href="about:blank#The_Venphira_Family_Estate" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">his family's estate</a> for the first time. While he was exploring, his was lured away from a busy street and was kidnapped by a seemingly sweet <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Gladva (x) - LoA master" data-href="#Gladva (x) - LoA master" href="about:blank#Gladva_(x)_-_LoA_master" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">woman</a>. 
<br>Irosys was then indoctrinated into the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="League of Assassins" data-href="League of Assassins" href="2.-world/2.7-organizations/2.72-unofficial/league-of-assassins.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">LoA</a> and enrolled into its young development program. Through this program Irosys was placed on a team with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Talia (x) - LoA team member" data-href="#Talia (x) - LoA team member" href="about:blank#Talia_(x)_-_LoA_team_member" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Talia</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dusan (x) - LoA team member" data-href="#Dusan (x) - LoA team member" href="about:blank#Dusan_(x)_-_LoA_team_member" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dusan</a>, and they were mentored by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Gladva (x) - LoA master" data-href="#Gladva (x) - LoA master" href="about:blank#Gladva_(x)_-_LoA_master" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gladva</a>.
<br>Irosys was 9 years old at this time.
<br>6579 - Start of Campaign<br>
<br>As part of a long-term mission, Irosys was allowed to return to his family and reintigrate back into high society. He approached his sister and her guards while at the local market plaza in <a data-href="Hollyhock#Diamond Heights" href="2.-world/2.3-cities/hollyhock.html#Diamond_Heights" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Diamond Heights</a>. He proved his legitimacy by showing his version of their family ring, and he was rushed back to the estate.
<br>His mother and sister immediately welcomed him back into the family, but it took much longer for the remaining close family to do the same. It's only recently that Irosys has been invited to family gatherings, and allowed to socialize unattended at high-profile events. 
<br>Any inquiries into the years before his return were met with vague answers and deflections from his mother.

The family estate is essentially the same as in the picture below. The estate is not near a body of water.<br>

<br>Before getting kicked out, Kaimop spent most of his time either working at his family’s tavern, mining iron with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dartanian (2) - best-friend" data-href="#Dartanian (2) - best-friend" href="about:blank#Dartanian_(2)_-_best-friend" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dartanian</a>, or doing odd jobs around the neighborhood. 
<br>A pastime not relating to work that Kaimop liked to do was repainting the signposts around his neighborhood. A contract miner, he only mined if he was called in.&nbsp;
<br>6559 (25 years ago)<br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Jasper (3) - father" data-href="#Jasper (3) - father" href="about:blank#Jasper_(3)_-_father" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jasper</a> found Kaimop near an abandoned railroad station in Copper Lane, Anemone.&nbsp;
<br>6566 (18 years ago)<br>
<br>Kaimop, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Malba (2) - older sister" data-href="#Malba (2) - older sister" href="about:blank#Malba_(2)_-_older_sister" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Malba</a>, and Dartanian found signposts for the first time.
<br>Kaimop was 7 years old at this time.
<br>6575 (9 years ago)<br>
<br>Kaimop met <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mariana (1) - maternal figure" data-href="#Mariana (1) - maternal figure" href="about:blank#Mariana_(1)_-_maternal_figure" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mariana</a> and she became, essentially, his second mother. Eventually, he confronted her about the local rumors that he was her child. She denied it, but they kept the ruse amongst their neighbors. 
<br>Dartanian started working in the mines.
<br>Kaimop was 16 years old at this time.
<br>6578 (6 years ago)<br>
<br>Gabriel, Mariana’s fiance, died in a mining accident.&nbsp;
<br>Kaimop was 19 years old at this time.

<br>Kaimop was 22 years old at this time.
<br>6584 (3 to 4 months ago)<br>
<br>Kaimop’s family essentially kicked him out of the house and tell him to discover something more to life than just working. They view him as an empty shell that needs to be filled with something more than just a work ethic. They think Kaimop needs to live a better life than what he’s currently living.
<br><br><br><br>
<br>The home is located behind the family-owned tavern. One story with five modest bedrooms (each bedroom includes a bed, drawers &amp; a small closet). The living/dining room is the centerpiece of the home and is decently sized.

<br>Met <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Becian (5) - older brother" data-href="#Becian (5) - older brother" href="about:blank#Becian_(5)_-_older_brother" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Becain</a> while he was rushing to attend a banking seminar a district over. In a very rom-com way, he bumped into her, which caused her to spill her drink all over his shirt. He offered to buy her another drink, and she offered him her afternoon. They talked all day, and Becian never made it to the banking seminar. Becian eventually married her and they have a child named <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Calca (6) - niece" data-href="#Calca (6) - niece" href="about:blank#Calca_(6)_-_niece" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Calca</a>.
<br><br><br>Appearance<br>
<br>Human, 42 years old
<br>Sandy blond hair and pale brown eyes. Wears clothes that are well worn and well-loved.
<br>Personality: <br>
<br>Quiet and soft-spoken around most folks. Becomes visibly nervous in unfamiliar situations, but can push through most of the time.
<br>Background: <br>
<br>Mariana has lived in <a data-href="Anemone#Copper Lane" href="2.-world/2.3-cities/anemone.html#Copper_Lane" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Copper Lane</a> all her life, and is locally known as the woman who sold her newborn baby to a noble. Neighbors assumed that Kaimop was that newborn baby because he was often seen trailing after her when he was younger. 
<br>Eventually, he confronted her about the rumors, and she assured him that he was not her biological son. She begged Kaimop to keep the truth a secret because it would be easier for everyone, and he agreed. A few years later, Kaimop was her biggest support when her fiance died in the mines. During this time, Kaimop learned about the abuse she suffered from her ex-husband years before she met her fiance.
<br><br>Appearance: <br>
<br>Half-Orc, 22 years old 
<br>Dark green skin, black wavy hair, and gray eyes. Has a boyish charm to him and dresses neatly.
<br>Personality: <br>
<br>Naturally boisterous and is known to give into his chaotic tendencies.
<br>Background: <br>
<br>Started working in the copper mines when he was 16 years old, and has a history/backstory commonly seen in Copper Lane. He has known Kaimop’s family for years, and has pinned for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Peony (1) - younger sister" data-href="#Peony (1) - younger sister" href="about:blank#Peony_(1)_-_younger_sister" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Peony</a> for almost as long as he’s known her. 
<br>When they were younger, Kaimop, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Malba (2) - older sister" data-href="#Malba (2) - older sister" href="about:blank#Malba_(2)_-_older_sister" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Malba</a> and him were the three musketeers. The trio would often be seen redesigning the signs all over the neighborhood. Soon after Kaimop left, Dartanian gently turned down Malba’s affections, and hasn’t seen much of her since. He talks to Peony the most out of Kaimop’s family now, but they really only met to recolor signs. He seems quite lonely.
<br><br>Appearance:<br>
<br>Human, 28 years old
<br>Bronze skin, black curly hair, and light brown eyes. 
<br>No matter what he wears, there always seems to be oil/grease stains on it. (Leo Valdez aesthetic.)&nbsp;
<br>Personality: <br>
<br>A man of few words. Gruff, but incredibly kind. Values loyalty and familial bonds. Can be very talkative when he gets passionate about a subject.&nbsp;
<br>Backstory: <br>
<br>York moved from his home district of {blank}, 3 years before the start of the campaign due to his parents’ passing. Before working in the mines, he was the local handyman in his neighborhood. 
<br>Soon after moving to Copper Lane, York met Kaimop while mining and became fast friends. They could go a whole day without saying a word to each other and they enjoy their shared silence. Before Kaimop started his journey, York offered to join him but Kaimop told him to stay home to watch over everyone. After having her advances rejected by <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dartanian (2) - best-friend" data-href="#Dartanian (2) - best-friend" href="about:blank#Dartanian_(2)_-_best-friend" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dartanian</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Malba (2) - older sister" data-href="#Malba (2) - older sister" href="about:blank#Malba_(2)_-_older_sister" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Malba</a> has started hanging out with York.

<br><br><br>FEB 8, 6539<br>
<br>Wynn was born as a sickly baby in her family home. 
<br>6547<br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Nenethiel Elledyr (1) - father" data-href="#Nenethiel Elledyr (1) - father" href="about:blank#Nenethiel_Elledyr_(1)_-_father" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Wynn's father</a> retired as a cleric at <a data-href="Hollyhock#The Oasis" href="2.-world/2.3-cities/hollyhock.html#The_Oasis" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Oasis</a> to spend more time with his family. He opened his own private health clinic close to home. Although the family still goes to the temple every week.
DM Question
does the health clinic have a quirky name? or are you leaving it up to DM?


<br>During this year, Wynn finished Basics and continued her education at the library with the help of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Maylin Elledyr (2) - mother" data-href="#Maylin Elledyr (2) - mother" href="about:blank#Maylin_Elledyr_(2)_-_mother" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">her mother</a> and other library staff.
<br>Wynn was 8 years old at this time.

<br>6553 - 6581<br>
<br>
Wynn spent this time bouncing between jobs to support her family. She worked part-time at the library her mother works at, helped her father with administration work and the family clinic, and worked night shifts at a local tavern.
DM Question

<br>did Wynn's father hire anyone else at the family clinic? if he did, are they important in any way? or are you leaving it up to DM?
<br>is the local tavern important to Wynn in anyway? same questions as ones above



<br>
Towards the end of this period of Wynn's life, she grew bored and a bit stir crazy and was looking to do more with her life. She began looking into clerical training because of three main factors:

<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Alma (1)" data-href="#Alma (1)" href="about:blank#Alma_(1)" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Her childhood friend</a> had just recently gotten an apprenticeship and was encouraging her to join
<br>Being a sickly child growing up
<br>Watching <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Nenethiel Elledyr (1) - father" data-href="#Nenethiel Elledyr (1) - father" href="about:blank#Nenethiel_Elledyr_(1)_-_father" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">her father</a> help others as a cleric of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Tempest, the Waterbearer" data-href="Tempest, the Waterbearer" href="2.-world/2.6-deities/2.61-the-true-gods/tempest,-the-waterbearer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Waterbearer</a>


<br>
Wynn was 14 to 42 years old during this time period.

<br>6581<br>
<br>Wynn started her cleric training and became a student under <a data-href="#{blank} (2)" href="about:blank#{blank}_(2)" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">{blank} (2)</a>. She was perceived as a 'late bloomer' due to her inability to use magic.
<br>Wynn was 42 years old at this time.
<br>DEC 30, 6583<br>
<br>Wynn was summoned to <a data-href="Hollyhock#The Oasis" href="2.-world/2.3-cities/hollyhock.html#The_Oasis" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Oasis</a> and subsequently expelled from clerical training. In a fit of anger, Wynn stole a mace off of a statue in the temple, and was never seen there again.
<br>Wynn was 44 years old at this time.
<br>JAN 5, 6584<br>
<br>Wynn went through a week of existential sulking and religious guilt before she gave herself a haircut for a "fresh look, fresh start." The haircut turned out so bad she shaved half of her head in a panic by accident.
<br>JAN 8, 6584<br>
<br>Wynn had a strange dream this night where she was alone in a void and heard a voice ask her, "Do you want to help people?" Wynn said yes and immediately jolted awake, but then quickly went back to sleep.

<br>JAN 9, 6584<br>
<br>Wynn casted Eldritch Blast at her morning coffee by accident. Later in the day, she noticed that a streak of white hair had formed at the back of her head. She decided to keep her newfound abilities secret.
<br>JAN 10, 6584 - Start of Campaign<br>
<br>Wynn spent most of her time in libraries secretly reading about magic, and she eventually came to the conclusion that she had unintentionally signed a Warlock Pact. From then on she kept a journal that tracked any accidental uses of magic and strange occurrences. While reading about magic, Wynn stumbled upon cases of unfair and/or dangerous pacts, which inspired her to apply for law school.
<br>Wynn was 45 years old at this time.
<br><br><br><br>
<br>Humble, old little home that has seen better days. Two stories with a basement. Kinda looks like the home of a really nice grandma: old but comforting, and filled with trinkets.
